<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rare Hematology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recombinant Factors</li><li>Plasma Derived Factors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rare hematology market is primarily segmented into two types: recombinant factors and plasma-derived factors. Recombinant factors are genetically engineered proteins used to replace missing clotting factors in patients with conditions like hemophilia. They offer consistency and reduced risk of viral contamination. Plasma-derived factors, on the other hand, are extracted from human plasma and contain multiple clotting factors, making them effective for treating bleeding disorders, but carry risks associated with bloodborne pathogens. Both segments play crucial roles in managing rare hematological disorders.</p></p>
