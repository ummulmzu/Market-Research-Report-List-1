<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double-Pipe Exchanger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reverse Flow</li><li>Cocurrent Flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Double-pipe heat exchangers can operate in two primary flow arrangements: reverse flow and cocurrent flow. In reverse flow, the fluids flow in opposite directions, enhancing temperature exchange efficiency by maintaining a higher temperature gradient throughout the length of the exchanger. Conversely, in cocurrent flow, both fluids move in the same direction, resulting in a more uniform temperature profile but often a reduced heat transfer efficiency compared to reverse flow. The choice of flow type depends on the specific application requirements and thermal performance goals.</p></p>
